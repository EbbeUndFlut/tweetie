### What we learned

On this final project of our Supercode coding bootcamp the most important challenge was to work in a team. Beside the technical aspects of the project we had to organize our work force, split work and bring together what each team member achieved. We managed that with several short meetings during the day and always being available for little (or bigger) questions. 

While the design of the project was pretty simple, we still had some learnings how to buidl proper compoments and how to use them in several files. The fetches to get date from the backend were the most difficult part. 

Backend in general was more complex than we expected at the beginning because databases and collections had to be connected. Another topic we solved was login and registration via cookie token and to uploas profile pictures. 

### Continued development

The next step would be to create profile pages, to able to make changes in profiles or even delete them. Another point we would like to add is the ability to upload GIFs as a comment.
